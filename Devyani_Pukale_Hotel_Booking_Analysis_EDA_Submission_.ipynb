The data type of each column was also checked, and any inaccuracies were corrected in the Data Cleaning and Manipulation phase.In this dataset there are both duplicates and missing values available.

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.Here, it is given a hotel booking dataset. This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel."
